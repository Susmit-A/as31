This is a beta test release of AS31.

To build on Linux, just type "make".  To install, copy
the binaries to a directory in your search path, such
as /usr/local/bin.  It's that simple.  For other unix
platforms, you may need to edit the Makefile.


Please report any problems to

Thank you.  I hope you find AS31 useful.
